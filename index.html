        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I have learned a lot in past 4 years in high school. From C++, by PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ending with the Python. I fall in love with Django once and we are still meeting sometimes. I love programming and learning new stuff all the time. I currently learn Go.</p>

        <h3>Automations</h3>
        <p>It is linked to programming but I want to give a much closer look what I am truly doing. I've chosen Python as my main language because of it's beauty. I pay a lot attention to code to look as beautiful as it can. Automation is the thing that Python handles very well where comes to find a quick solution to a problem that just appeared. Once I had a problem to download all of my favourite music from my YouTube playlist so I wrote few lines of code and<a href="https://github.com/LunarCommands/youtube_playlist_converter" target="blank">there it is.</a> </p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>The fact that I like to solve problems should not surprise anyone anymore. Since I was a little kid I loved everything related to hacking. Someday I came across the site with CTF's and it got me hooked to this day. From CTF's, by hacking my way in to the hackthebox site, ending with pentesting. All legal of course ðŸ˜‰.</p>

        <h3>Music Production</h3>
        <p>Since I was a little kid I've always loved electronic music. Well, I think I love everything related to computers ðŸ˜œ. I started my music journey listening to the very famous group - The Prodigy whose still big inspiration for me. I got through many electronic genres from Drum and Bass to Techno. The part of me that is responsible for creativity has spoken and I have started making music. It is inseparable part of me which I satisfy in my free time.</p>
